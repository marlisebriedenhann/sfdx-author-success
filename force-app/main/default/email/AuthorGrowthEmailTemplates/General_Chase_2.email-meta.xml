    <subject>Sign up early for the new PhotoDune &amp; Envato Elements special offer!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {!Account.Name},

I wanted to touch base with you once again concerning important changes with PhotoDune and how they impact you directly.

We are taking a different approach to how we do stock photography at Envato and your portfolio tells us you’re the kind of photographer we’re looking for in this new world of PhotoDune + Envato Elements. This is a great opportunity for more exposure in a smaller, more selective library and additional, recurring earnings on our new subscription product Envato Elements.

In order to get involved, we need you to take some action. Here are the details:

Special, limited-time PhotoDune non-exclusive author fee for early sign-ups, reduced from 55% down to 37.5%. That’s around 50% net earnings from every sale!
Join a select group of contributors on Envato Elements and earn your share of 50% of Elements’ net revenue, calculated under our innovative subscriber share model
Choose your own pricing on PhotoDune
Automatic approval/instant upload (no more review queues)

What you'll need to do:

Step one is to make your items available for inclusion on Envato Elements. Envato Elements is a separate company to PhotoDune with its own set of contributor terms, so please take some time to read and accept the Envato Elements Contributor Agreement

That’s it! If you have questions about any of this, please feel free to reach out to me directly (josh.sprague@envato.com).

Thanks,

{!User.FirstName}
