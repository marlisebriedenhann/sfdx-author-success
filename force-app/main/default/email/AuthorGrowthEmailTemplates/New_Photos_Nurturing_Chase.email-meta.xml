Hi {!Lead.Company}

A short time ago you responded to our invite to upload photos to Envato Elements and the PhotoDune marketplace.


We wanted to follow up as we’ve yet to hear from you. If you're still interested please create a free Envato Author Account. https://author.envato.com/join


Once you’ve created your Envato Market account, please send me your username so we can set up your photo manager!


Feel free to ask any questions you may have and hope to hear from you soon! :-)

Regards,
