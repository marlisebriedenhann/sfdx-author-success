<p>Hello {!Account.Name},</p>
<p>I wanted to touch base with you once again concerning important changes with PhotoDune and how they impact you directly.</p>
<p>We are taking a different approach to how we do stock photography at Envato and your portfolio tells us you&rsquo;re the kind of photographer we&rsquo;re looking for in this new world of PhotoDune + Envato Elements. This is a <strong>great opportunity for more exposure</strong> in a smaller, more selective library and additional, <strong>recurring earnings</strong> on our new subscription product Envato Elements.</p>
<p>In order to get involved, <strong>we need you to take some action.</strong> Here are the details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Special, limited-time PhotoDune <strong>non-exclusive</strong> author fee for early sign-ups, reduced from 55% down to <strong>37.5%</strong>. That&rsquo;s around 50% net earnings from every sale!</li>
<li>Join a select group of contributors on <a href="https://elements.envato.com">Envato Elements</a> and earn your share of 50% of Elements&rsquo; net revenue, calculated under our innovative <a href="https://help.contributors.elements.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/216749198-What-is-the-Subscriber-Share-model-">subscriber share model</a></li>
<li><a href="https://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/204651020-Selecting-a-Price-on-an-Author-Driven-Pricing-Category">Choose your own pricing on PhotoDune</a></li>
<li>Automatic approval/instant upload (no more review queues)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What you'll need to do:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Step one is to <strong>make your items available for inclusion on Envato Elements</strong>. Envato Elements is a separate company to PhotoDune with its own set of contributor terms, so please take some time to read and accept the <a href="https://envato.formstack.com/forms/envato_elements_terms_photodune">Envato Elements Contributor Agreement</a></li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s it! If you have questions about any of this, please feel free to reach out to me directly (josh.sprague@envato.com).</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
