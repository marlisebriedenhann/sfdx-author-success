Hello again,

<p>{!User.FirstName} here from Envato! </p>

<p>Thank you for promptly signing the Envato Elements Contributor Agreement. This was the first of two very important steps. Before we can move you forward however we need you to fill out your tax form!</p>

<b>Complete your form here:</b> <a href="https://photodune.net/user/{!Account.Name}/tax_information/new">https://photodune.net/user/{!Account.Name}/tax_information/new</a>

<p>Envato is required by law to withhold certain taxes from your earnings as a Elements contributor and we use the country information from your tax form to calculate the amount to withhold. More information about this and instructions for how to complete your tax form are in our help center: <a href="https://help.contributors.elements.envato.com/hc/en-us/sections/205905868-Tax-and-Withholding">https://help.contributors.elements.envato.com/hc/en-us/sections/205905868-Tax-and-Withholding</a></p>

<p><b>We can’t move you ahead in the process until this step is complete</b> so please fill in your tax form by no later than <b>Monday 17th April 2017</b> and let us know when you're done. <b>Unfortunately after that date we will begin the process of removing your PhotoDune items</b> as part of our clean up process and you’ll need to <a href="https://envato.formstack.com/forms/photodune_interest">reapply to join</a> PhotoDune & Elements when we reopen applications. If you are selling other item types on other Envato marketplaces, those items will not be affected by this change on PhotoDune.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
