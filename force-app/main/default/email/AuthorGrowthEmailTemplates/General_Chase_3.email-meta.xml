    <textOnly>Hi {!Account.Name},

Photos on Elements is launching soon.

In order to get involved, we need you to take some action.

You’re the kind of photographer we’re looking for in this new world of PhotoDune + Envato Elements and this is a great opportunity for more exposure in a smaller, more selective library and additional, recurring earnings on our new subscription product Envato Elements.

Special, Limited-time PhotoDune non-exclusive author of 37.5%. That’s around 50% net earnings from every sale!
Join a select group of contributors on Envato Elements and earn your share of 50% of Elements’ net revenue, calculated under our innovative subscriber share model as an additional revenue stream
Choose your own pricing on PhotoDune

What you’ll need to do:

Step one is to make your photos available for inclusion on Envato Elements. Envato Elements is a separate company to PhotoDune with its own set of contributor terms, so please take some time to read and accept the Envato Elements Contributor Agreement.

That’s it! If you have questions about any of this, please feel free to reach out to me directly.

Thanks,

{!User.FirstName}
